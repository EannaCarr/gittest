For example, the Nexus One returns `Passion`, and Motorola Droid returns `voles`.\n\n### Tizen Quirks\n\n- Returns the device model assigned by the vendor, for example, `TIZEN`\n\n### Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks\n\n- Returns the device model specified by the manufacturer. For example, the Samsung Focus returns `SGH-i917`.\n\n## device.platform\n\nGet the device's operating system name.\n\n    var string = device.platform;\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android\n- BlackBerry 10\n- Browser4\n- Firefox OS\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Depending on the device, a few examples are:\n    //   - \"Android\"\n    //   - \"BlackBerry 10\"\n    //   - Browser:         returns \"MacIntel\" on Mac\n    //                      returns \"Win32\" on Windows\n    //   - \"iOS\"\n    //   - \"WinCE\"\n    //   - \"Tizen\"\n    var devicePlatform = device.platform;\n\n### Windows Phone 7 Quirks\n\nWindows Phone 7 devices report the platform as `WinCE`.\n\n### Windows Phone 8 Quirks\n\nWindows Phone 8 devices report the platform as `Win32NT`.\n\n## device.uuid\n\nGet the device's Universally Unique Identifier ([UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier)).\n\n    var string = device.uuid;\n\n### Description\n\nThe details of how a UUID is generated are determined by the device manufacturer and are specific to the device's platform or model.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android\n- BlackBerry 10\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Android: Returns a random 64-bit integer (as a string, again!)\n    //          The integer is generated on the device's first boot\n    //\n    // BlackBerry: Returns the PIN number of the device\n    //             This is a nine-digit unique integer (as a string, though!)\n    //\n    // iPhone: (Paraphrased from the UIDevice Class documentation)\n    //         Returns a string of hash values created from multiple hardware identifies.\n    //         It is guaranteed to be unique for every device and can't be tied\n    //         to the user account.\n    // Windows Phone 7 : Returns a hash of device+current user,\n    // if the user is not defined, a guid is generated and will persist until the app is uninstalled\n    // Tizen: returns the device IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity or IMEI is a number\n    // unique to every GSM and UMTS mobile phone.\n    var deviceID = device.uuid;\n\n### iOS Quirk\n\nThe `uuid` on iOS is not unique to a device, but varies for each\napplication, for each installation.  It changes if you delete and\nre-install the app, and possibly also when you upgrade iOS, or even\nupgrade the app per version (apparent in iOS 5.1). The `uuid` is not\na reliable value.\n\n### Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks\n\nThe `uuid` for Windows Phone 7 requires the permission\n`ID_CAP_IDENTITY_DEVICE`.  Microsoft will likely deprecate this\nproperty soon.  If the capability is not available, the application\ngenerates a persistent guid that is maintained for the duration of the\napplication's installation on the device.\n\n## device.version\n\nGet the operating system version.\n\n    var string = device.version;\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android 2.1+\n- BlackBerry 10\n- Browser\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Android:    Froyo OS would return \"2.2\"\n    //             Eclair OS would return \"2.1\", \"2.0.1\", or \"2.0\"\n    //             Version can also return update level \"2.1-update1\"\n    //\n    // BlackBerry: Torch 9800 using OS 6.0 would return \"6.0.0.600\"\n    //\n    // Browser:    Returns version number for the browser\n    //\n    // iPhone:     iOS 3.2 returns \"3.2\"\n    //\n    // Windows Phone 7: returns current OS version number, ex. on Mango returns 7.10.7720\n    // Tizen: returns \"TIZEN_20120425_2\"\n    var deviceVersion = device.version;\n\n","readme":"<!---\n license: Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n         or more contributor license agreements.

The `uuid` is not\na reliable value.\n\n### Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks\n\nThe `uuid` for Windows Phone 7 requires the permission\n`ID_CAP_IDENTITY_DEVICE`.  Microsoft will likely deprecate this\nproperty soon.  If the capability is not available, the application\ngenerates a persistent guid that is maintained for the duration of the\napplication's installation on the device.\n\n## device.version\n\nGet the operating system version.\n\n    var string = device.version;\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android 2.1+\n- BlackBerry 10\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Android:    Froyo OS would return \"2.2\"\n    //             Eclair OS would return \"2.1\", \"2.0.1\", or \"2.0\"\n    //             Version can also return update level \"2.1-update1\"\n    //\n    // BlackBerry: Torch 9800 using OS 6.0 would return \"6.0.0.600\"\n    //\n    // iPhone:     iOS 3.2 returns \"3.2\"\n    //\n    // Windows Phone 7: returns current OS version number, ex. on Mango returns 7.10.7720\n    // Tizen: returns \"TIZEN_20120425_2\"\n    var deviceVersion = device.version;\n\n","readme":"<!---\n license: Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n         or more contributor license agreements.

The value is set by the device manufacturer and may be\ndifferent across versions of the same product.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android\n- BlackBerry 10\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Android:    Nexus One       returns \"Passion\" (Nexus One code name)\n    //             Motorola Droid  returns \"voles\"\n    // BlackBerry: Torch 9800      returns \"9800\"\n    // iOS:     for the iPad Mini, returns iPad2,5; iPhone 5 is iPhone 5,1. See http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Models\n    //\n    var model = device.model;\n\n### Android Quirks\n\n- Gets the [product name](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#PRODUCT) instead of the [model name](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#MODEL), which is often the production code name. For example, the Nexus One returns `Passion`, and Motorola Droid returns `voles`.\n\n### Tizen Quirks\n\n- Returns the device model assigned by the vendor, for example, `TIZEN`\n\n### Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks\n\n- Returns the device model specified by the manufacturer. For example, the Samsung Focus returns `SGH-i917`.\n\n## device.name\n\n__WARNING__: `device.name` is deprecated as of version 2.3.0. Use `device.model` instead.\n\n## device.platform\n\nGet the device's operating system name.\n\n    var string = device.platform;\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android\n- BlackBerry 10\n- Firefox OS\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Depending on the device, a few examples are:\n    //   - \"Android\"\n    //   - \"BlackBerry 10\"\n    //   - \"iOS\"\n    //   - \"WinCE\"\n    //   - \"Tizen\"\n    var devicePlatform = device.platform;\n\n### Windows Phone 7 Quirks\n\nWindows Phone 7 devices report the platform as `WinCE`.\n\n### Windows Phone 8 Quirks\n\nWindows Phone 8 devices report the platform as `Win32NT`.\n\n## device.uuid\n\nGet the device's Universally Unique Identifier ([UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier)).\n\n    var string = device.uuid;\n\n### Description\n\nThe details of how a UUID is generated are determined by the device manufacturer and are specific to the device's platform or model.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android\n- BlackBerry 10\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Android: Returns a random 64-bit integer (as a string, again!)\n    //          The integer is generated on the device's first boot\n    //\n    // BlackBerry: Returns the PIN number of the device\n    //             This is a nine-digit unique integer (as a string, though!)\n    //\n    // iPhone: (Paraphrased from the UIDevice Class documentation)\n    //         Returns a string of hash values created from multiple hardware identifies.\n    //         It is guaranteed to be unique for every device and can't be tied\n    //         to the user account.\n    // Windows Phone 7 : Returns a hash of device+current user,\n    // if the user is not defined, a guid is generated and will persist until the app is uninstalled\n    // Tizen: returns the device IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity or IMEI is a number\n    // unique to every GSM and UMTS mobile phone.\n    var deviceID = device.uuid;\n\n### iOS Quirk\n\nThe `uuid` on iOS is not unique to a device, but varies for each\napplication, for each installation.  It changes if you delete and\nre-install the app, and possibly also when you upgrade iOS, or even\nupgrade the app per version (apparent in iOS 5.1). The `uuid` is not\na reliable value.\n\n### Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks\n\nThe `uuid` for Windows Phone 7 requires the permission\n`ID_CAP_IDENTITY_DEVICE`.  Microsoft will likely deprecate this\nproperty soon.  If the capability is not available, the application\ngenerates a persistent guid that is maintained for the duration of the\napplication's installation on the device.\n\n## device.version\n\nGet the operating system version.\n\n    var string = device.version;\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- Android 2.1+\n- BlackBerry 10\n- iOS\n- Tizen\n- Windows Phone 7 and 8\n- Windows 8\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    // Android:    Froyo OS would return \"2.2\"\n    //             Eclair OS would return \"2.1\", \"2.0.1\", or \"2.0\"\n    //             Version can also return update level \"2.1-update1\"\n    //\n    // BlackBerry: Torch 9800 using OS 6.0 would return \"6.0.0.600\"\n    //\n    // iPhone:     iOS 3.2 returns \"3.2\"\n    //\n    // Windows Phone 7: returns current OS version number, ex. on Mango returns 7.10.7720\n    // Tizen: returns \"TIZEN_20120425_2\"\n    var deviceVersion = device.version;\n\n","readme":"<!---\n license: Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n         or more contributor license agreements.
