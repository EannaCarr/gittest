If\nyou are happy with how console.log() works for you, then you probably\ndon't need this plugin.\n\n## Installation\n\n    cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.console\n\n### Android Quirks\n\nOn some platforms other than Android, console.log() will act on multiple\narguments, such as console.log(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"). However, Android will act only\non the first argument. Subsequent arguments to console.log() will be ignored.\nThis plugin is not the cause of that, it is a limitation of Android itself.\n","readme":"<!---\n license: Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n         or more contributor license agreements.
